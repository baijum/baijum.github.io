One day when she was two years old she was playing in a garden, and she plucked another flower and ran with it to her mother. I suppose she must have looked rather delightful, for Mrs. Darling put her hand to her heart and cried, “Oh, why can’t you remain like this for ever!” This was all that passed between them on the subject, but henceforth Wendy knew that she must grow up. You always know after you are two. Two is the beginning of the end.   Mrs. Darling first heard of Peter when she was tidying up her children’s minds. It is the nightly custom of every good mother after her children are asleep to rummage in their minds and put things straight for next morning, repacking into their proper places the many articles that have wandered during the day.     This post has a manual excerpt &lt;!--more--&gt; set after the second paragraph. The following YAML Front Matter has also be applied:   excerpt_separator: \"&lt;!--more--&gt;\"   If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.   I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.   Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.   Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.   Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.  ","categories": ["docs","Post Formats"],

Now, on the St. Louis team we have Who’s on first, What’s on second, I Don’t Know is on third–   Costello: That’s what I want to find out. I want you to tell me the names of the fellows on the St. Louis team.   Abbott: I’m telling you. Who’s on first, What’s on second, I Don’t Know is on third–   Costello: You know the fellows’ names?

Costello: The guy on first base.   Abbott: Who is on first.   Costello: Well, what are you askin’ me for?   Abbott: I’m not asking you–I’m telling you. Who is on first.   Costello: I’m asking you–who’s on first?   Abbott: That’s the man’s name.   Costello: That’s who’s name?   Abbott: Yes.   Costello: When you pay off the first baseman every month, who gets the money?   Abbott: Every dollar of it. And why not, the man’s entitled to it.   Costello: Who is?   Abbott: Yes.   Costello: So who gets it?   Abbott: Why shouldn’t he? Sometimes his wife comes down and collects it.   Costello: Who’s wife?   Abbott: Yes. After all, the man earns it.   Costello: Who does?   Abbott: Absolutely.   Costello: Well, all I’m trying to find out is what’s the guy’s name on first base?   Abbott: Oh, no, no. What is on second base.   Costello: I’m not asking you who’s on second.   Abbott: Who’s on first!   Costello: St. Louis has a good outfield?   Abbott: Oh, absolutely.   Costello: The left fielder’s name?   Abbott: Why.   Costello: I don’t know, I just thought I’d ask.   Abbott: Well, I just thought I’d tell you.   Costello: Then tell me who’s playing left field?   Abbott: Who’s playing first.   Costello: Stay out of the infield! The left fielder’s name?   Abbott: Why.   Costello: Because.   Abbott: Oh, he’s center field.   Costello: Wait a minute. You got a pitcher on this team?   Abbott: Wouldn’t this be a fine team without a pitcher?   Costello: Tell me the pitcher’s name.   Abbott: Tomorrow.   Costello: Now, when the guy at bat bunts the ball–me being a good catcher–I want to throw the guy out at first base, so I pick up the ball and throw it to who?   Abbott: Now, that’s he first thing you’ve said right.   Costello: I DON’T EVEN KNOW WHAT I’M TALKING ABOUT!   Abbott: Don’t get excited. Take it easy.   Costello: I throw the ball to first base, whoever it is grabs the ball, so the guy runs to second. Who picks up the ball and throws it to what. What throws it to I don’t know. I don’t know throws it back to tomorrow–a triple play.   Abbott: Yeah, it could be.   Costello: Another guy gets up and it’s a long ball to center.   Abbott: Because.   Costello: Why? I don’t know.

If you could keep awake (but of course you can’t) you would see your own mother doing this, and you would find it very interesting to watch her. It is quite like tidying up drawers. You would see her on her knees, I expect, lingering humorously over some of your contents, wondering where on earth you had picked this thing up, making discoveries sweet and not so sweet, pressing this to her cheek as if it were as nice as a kitten, and hurriedly stowing that out of sight. When you wake in the morning, the naughtiness and evil passions with which you went to bed have been folded up small and placed at the bottom of your mind and on the top, beautifully aired, are spread out your prettier thoughts, ready for you to put on.   I don’t know whether you have ever seen a map of a person’s mind. Doctors sometimes draw maps of other parts of you, and your own map can become intensely interesting, but catch them trying to draw a map of a child’s mind, which is not only confused, but keeps going round all the time. There are zigzag lines on it, just like your temperature on a card, and these are probably roads in the island, for the Neverland is always more or less an island, with astonishing splashes of colour here and there, and coral reefs and rakish-looking craft in the offing, and savages and lonely lairs, and gnomes who are mostly tailors, and caves through which a river runs, and princes with six elder brothers, and a hut fast going to decay, and one very small old lady with a hooked nose. It would be an easy map if that were all, but there is also first day at school, religion, fathers, the round pond, needle-work, murders, hangings, verbs that take the dative, chocolate pudding day, getting into braces, say ninety-nine, three-pence for pulling out your tooth yourself, and so on, and either these are part of the island or they are another map showing through, and it is all rather confusing, especially as nothing will stand still.   Of course the Neverlands vary a good deal. John’s, for instance, had a lagoon with flamingoes flying over it at which John was shooting, while Michael, who was very small, had a flamingo with lagoons flying over it. John lived in a boat turned upside down on the sands, Michael in a wigwam, Wendy in a house of leaves deftly sewn together. John had no friends, Michael had friends at night, Wendy had a pet wolf forsaken by its parents, but on the whole the Neverlands have a family resemblance, and if they stood still in a row you could say of them that they have each other’s nose, and so forth. On these magic shores children at play are for ever beaching their coracles [simple boat]. We too have been there; we can still hear the sound of the surf, though we shall land no more.   Of all delectable islands the Neverland is the snuggest and most compact, not large and sprawly, you know, with tedious distances between one adventure and another, but nicely crammed. When you play at it by day with the chairs and table-cloth, it is not in the least alarming, but in the two minutes before you go to sleep it becomes very real. That is why there are night-lights.   Occasionally in her travels through her children’s minds Mrs. Darling found things she could not understand, and of these quite the most perplexing was the word Peter. She knew of no Peter, and yet he was here and there in John and Michael’s minds, while Wendy’s began to be scrawled all over with him. The name stood out in bolder letters than any of the other words, and as Mrs. Darling gazed she felt that it had an oddly cocky appearance.  ","categories": ["docs"],

        "excerpt":"Default   This is a paragraph. It should not have any alignment of any kind. It should just flow like you would normally expect. Nothing fancy. Just straight up text, free flowing, with love. Completely neutral and not picking a side or sitting on the fence. It just is. It just freaking is. It likes where it is. It does not feel compelled to pick a side. Leave him be. It will just be better that way. Trust me.   Left Align   This is a paragraph. It is left aligned. Because of this, it is a bit more liberal in it’s views. It’s favorite color is green. Left align tends to be more eco-friendly, but it provides no concrete evidence that it really is. Even though it likes share the wealth evenly, it leaves the equal distribution up to justified alignment.   Center Align   This is a paragraph. It is center aligned. Center is, but nature, a fence sitter. A flip flopper. It has a difficult time making up its mind. It wants to pick a side. Really, it does. It has the best intentions, but it tends to complicate matters more than help. The best you can do is try to win it over and hope for the best. I hear center align does take bribes.   Right Align   This is a paragraph. It is right aligned. It is a bit more conservative in it’s views. It’s prefers to not be told what to do or how to do it. Right align totally owns a slew of guns and loves to head to the range for some practice. Which is cool and all. I mean, it’s a pretty good shot from at least four or five football fields away. Dead on. So boss.   Justify Align   This is a paragraph. It is justify aligned. It gets really mad when people associate it with Justin Timberlake. Typically, justified is pretty straight laced. It likes everything to be in it’s place and not all cattywampus like the rest of the aligns. I am not saying that makes it better than the rest of the aligns, but it does tend to put off more of an elitist attitude.  ","categories": ["docs","Markup"],

        "excerpt":"Welcome to image alignment! The best way to demonstrate the ebb and flow of the various image positioning options is to nestle them snuggly among an ocean of words. Grab a paddle and let’s get started.      The image above happens to be centered.    The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is left aligned.   As you can see there should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too. Let them speak like you words. Let them do their jobs without any hassle from the text. In about one more sentence here, we’ll see that the text moves from the right of the image down below the image in seamless transition. Again, letting the do it’s thing. Mission accomplished!   And now for a massively large image. It also has no alignment.      The image above, though 1200px wide, should not overflow the content area. It should remain contained with no visible disruption to the flow of content.      And now we’re going to shift things to the right align. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there — Hey guy! Way to rock that right side. I don’t care what the left aligned image says, you look great. Don’t let anyone else tell you differently.   In just a bit here, you should see the text start to wrap below the right aligned image and settle in nicely. There should still be plenty of room and everything should be sitting pretty. Yeah — Just like that. It never felt so good to be right.   And just when you thought we were done, we’re going to do them all over again with captions!         Look at 580 x 300 getting some love.   The figure above happens to be centered. The caption also has a link in it, just to see if it does anything funky.         Itty-bitty caption.   The rest of this paragraph is filler for the sake of seeing the text wrap around the 150×150 image, which is left aligned.   As you can see there should be some space above, below, and to the right of the image. The text should not be creeping on the image. Creeping is just not right. Images need breathing room too.

And now for a massively large image. It also has no alignment.         Massive image comment for your eyeballs.   The figure element above has an inline style of width: 1200px set which should break it outside of the normal content flow.         Feels good to be right all the time.   And now we’re going to shift things to the right align. Again, there should be plenty of room above, below, and to the left of the image. Just look at him there — Hey guy!

The wikisource text contains Holy Bible translation into Malayalam language known as “Sathyavedapusthakam”.   I found Parsley very interesting after watching the PyCon talk by its author.  Parsley doesn’t support Python 3 yet.  Then, I used a fork to run my code.  The fork author has already send a pull request.  So, I hope Parsley will officially support Python 3 soon.   The format of my input file was something as given below.  The actual text contains a mix of Malayalam and English characters encoded in “utf-8” format. However, for simplicity I removed Malayalam from the below input text:   {{Some Text}} {{Navi| Prev=Some Text| Next=Some Text| }} {{Some Text}}  {{verse|1}} Verse One  {{Verse|2}} Verse Two  {{Navi| Prev=Some Text| Next=Some Text| }}   My parsing code is part of a bigger module with other functionalities. Here is a stripped-down version of my parsing code:   import sys import parsley  parser = parsley.makeGrammar(\"\"\" fix = '{{' &lt;((anything|ws):x ?(x not  in '}') -&gt; x)+&gt;:s '}}' -&gt; s num = '{{' ('V'|'v') 'erse|' &lt;digit+&gt;:s '}}' -&gt; int(s) text =  &lt;((anything|ws):x ?(x not in '{') -&gt; x)+&gt;:s  -&gt; s verse = (fix ws){3} (num:n text:t -&gt; (n, t))+:l fix anything* -&gt; l \"\"\", {})  wikitext = open(sys.argv[1]).read() verses = parser(wikitext).verse() print(verses)   I think, the parsing grammar should be possible to improve.  But this is what I reached after many iterations.  If you have any suggestions to improve the grammar, please send it to me :)   If you want to run the above code, save the input text given above in a file and run the program with the input file as an argument.   The output will be a list of tuples.  Each tuple contains an integer and string values.  Here is the output for the above input text:   [(1, ' Verse One\\n\\n'), (2, ' Verse Two\\n\\n')]   The official documentation has enough infomation about the usage. And the git repo has more examples.   ","categories": ["python"],

        "title": "An Introduction to Go Programming",
        "excerpt":"Go, also commonly referred to as golang, is a statically typed, compiled, garbage-collected, concurrent general purpose programming language.  Go is considered as an object oriented programming language and it uses object composition instead of class inheritance.  Go was initially developed at Google by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.  Go was publicly released as a free/open source software in November 2009 by Google.   There are two major compilers available, gc &amp; gccgo.  The official compiler is gc and gccgo is a front-end to gcc.  Go supports major operating systems including Windows, GNU/Linux, Mac OS X and various flavors of BSDs.  Through gccgo it supports more platforms. And cross compilation is easy in Go.      The syntax of Go is very similar to C programming language.  There are around 25+ keywords in the languages which is smaller compared to C, C++, Python etc.   Go compilation is very fast, few seconds would be enough to compile large programs.  In Go, unused imports and variables raise error during compile time.  A variable starting with capital letter is considered as exported and so it can be used from other packages.   Now I will move on to the details of installation of Go compiler. First you will see instruction for installing in GNU/Linux. The next section explains installation in a Windows system.   Finally I will show running a hello world program.  This will help you to verify your installation.   Linux Installation   Go project provides binaries for major operating systems including GNU/Linux.  You can find 32 bit and 64 bit binaries for GNU/Linux here: https://golang.org/dl/   The following commands will download and install Go compiler in a 64 bit GNU/Linux system:   cd $HOME wget -c https://storage.googleapis.com/golang/go1.7.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz tar zxvf go1.7.1.linux-amd64.tar.gz mkdir $HOME/mygo  The first line ensure that current working directory is the home directory for the user.  The $HOME environment variable contains the path to the user’s home directory.   The second line download the 64 bit binary for GNU/Linux.  The wget is a command line download manager.   The third line extract the downloaded tar ball in to go directory inside the home.   The last line creates a directory named mygo as the workspace.  This directory can be used to place binaries, third party packages and your own Go source code.   You also need to set few environment variables.  Open the $HOME/.bashrc file in a text editor and enter these lines:   export GOROOT=$HOME/go export PATH=$GOROOT/bin:$PATH  export GOPATH=$HOME/mygo export PATH=$GOPATH/bin:$PATH  The first line set GOROOT environment variable pointing to $HOME/go.  This is required for proper functioning of Go tools.  You can avoid setting the GOROOT environment variable if you install Go inside /usr/local/go.   The second line append the $GOROOT/bin to the PATH environment variable.  This will help you to run go, godoc &amp; gofmt commands from command line.   The third line set the GOPATH environment variable pointing to $HOME/mygo.  The GOPATH environment variable specifies the location of your Go workspace.   The last line append $GOPATH/bin to the PATH environment variable. This will help you to run any binaries installed.   Windows Installation   There are separate installers (MSI files) available for 32 bit &amp; 64 bit versions of Windows.  The 32 bit version MSI file will be named like this: go1.x.y.windows-386.msi (Replace x.y with the current version).  Similarly for 64 bit version, the MSI file will be named like this: go1.x.y.windows-amd64.msi (Replace x.y with the current version).   You can download the installers (MSI files) from here: https://golang.org/dl/   After downloading the installer file, you can open the MSI file by double clicking on that file.  This should prompts few things about the installation of the Go compiler.  The installer place the Go related files in the C:\\Go directory.   The installer also put the C:\\Go\\bin directory in the system PATH environment variable.  You may need to restart any open command prompts for the change to take effect.   You also need to create a directory to download third party packages from github.com or similar sites.  The directory can be created at C:\\mygo like this:   mkdir C:\\mygo  After this you can set GOPATH environment variable to point to this location.  Temporarily you can set it like this:   set GOPATH=C:\\mygo  You can also append C:\\mygo\\bin into the PATH environment variable.   If you do not know how to set environment variable, just do a Google search for: “set windows environment variable”.   The GOROOT environment variable is not required here as you have installed the Go inside C:\\Go folder.  If you have changed that location during the installation, set the GOROOT pointing to the location you selected.   Running a program   This section helps you to verify your installation by running a hello world program.   As you know Go is a compiled programming language.  However, there is a command which does both compilation and running the program.  The command line syntax to run the program is like this:   go run &lt;program.go&gt;  To run a hello world program, you can copy-paste the below code to your favorite text editor and save it as hello.go:   package main  import \"fmt\"  func main() {      fmt.Println(\"Hello, World!\") }  Once you saved the above source code into a file.  You can open your command line program (bash or cmd.exe) and run the above program like this:   go run hello.go  If you are able to see the output as Hello, World!, you have successfully installed Go compiler.   Building and Running Program   As you can see above, you can run the program using go run hello.go command.  You can also build (compile) and run the binary like this in GNU/Linux:   go build hello.go ./hello  The first command produce a binary and second comand is executing that binary.  You can do the same thing in Windows like this:   go build hello.go hello.exe  The go build command produce a binary file native to the operating system and the architecture of the CPU (i386, x86_64 etc.)  ","categories": ["golang"],

This was interesting, because my first Golang workshop particants were computer science engineering students and second was professional software developers.  The workshop was conducted on last week of April.  I know, this is very late update ;)   As usual, Go was very new to all particants.  The prgram went very well.

Since Calicut is my home town, I was very happy to accept their invitation. I can see that, the infrastructure in Calicut is improving every year. I hope this conference will help many software developers.  The venue location was was very good.  Few photos:        ","categories": ["golang","talk"],

        "title": "Gemified Theme -- Alpha Release",
        "excerpt":"Jekyll themes distributed as Ruby gems are finally here to make installing and upgrading much easier. Gone are the days of forking a repo just to “install it”. Or dealing with merge conflicts when pulling in upstream commits to “upgrade it”.   If you’re interested in testing out Minimal Mistakes as a gemified theme read on. There are a few caveats though:      Support for a theme assets folder was recently added to Jekyll core, but has yet to be released or rolled into the github-pages gem. Meaning you can’t use Minimal Mistakes as a Ruby gem there just yet… locally served or self-hosted installs should be fine if you don’t mind using a pre-release version of Jekyll.   Windows users can’t currently use themes packaged as gems due to a bug with file paths in Jekyll core. This is being worked on so hopefully a fix is on the way soon.   Fine with all that? Great. Let’s continue.   If you’re migrating a site already using Minimal Mistakes and haven’t customized any of the _includes, _layouts, _sass partials, or assets this should be quick and painless.   Step 1: Remove Theme Files   Remove _includes, _layouts, _sass, assets folders and files within. You won’t need these anymore as they’re bundled in the theme.   If you customized any of these then leave them alone and only remove the untouched ones. If setup correctly your modified versions should act as overrides to the versions bundled with the theme.   Step 2: Update Gemfile   In order to test you’ll need to install pre-release gems of Jekyll and Minimal Mistakes.   Start by replacing gem \"github-pages\" or gem \"jekyll\" with the following:   gem \"jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git\"   Then add the pre-release Minimal Mistakes theme gem:   gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch =&gt; \"feature/theme-gem\"`   When finished your Gemfile should look something like this:   source \"https://rubygems.org\"  gem \"jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll.git\" gem \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\", :git =&gt; \"https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes.git\", :branch =&gt; \"feature/theme-gem\"  group :jekyll_plugins do   # gem \"jekyll-archives\"   gem \"jekyll-paginate\"   gem \"jekyll-sitemap\"   gem \"jekyll-gist\"   gem \"jekyll-feed\" end   Step 3: Run Bundler   Run bundle install (or bundle update if you’re updating an existing repo) to install the pre-release gems.   Step 4: Install the Theme   Add theme: \"minimal-mistakes-jekyll\" to your _config.yml file.   If you’re migrating from an existing Minimal Mistakes site you shouldn’t have to change anything else after this. If it’s a new site consult then docs to properly config.   Please Note: Paths for image headers, overlays, teasers, galleries, and feature rows have changed and now require a full path. Instead of just image: filename.jpg you’ll need to use the full path eg: image: assets/images/filename.jpg. The preferred location is now assets/images but can be placed elsewhere or external hosted. This applies for image references in _config.yml and author.yml.   Step 5: jekyll new Tweaks   If this is a new site be sure to add the following files to _data/ and customize as you see fit. There is currently no way of bundling them in with the theme, so be sure to consult the docs on how to properly use both.      _data/ui-text.yml - UI text documentation   _data/navigation.yml - navigation documentation   You’ll also need to:      Replace &lt;site root&gt;/index.html with a modified Minimal Mistakes index.html.   Change layout: post in _posts/0000-00-00-welcome-to-jekyll.markdown to layout: single.   Remove about.md, or at the very least change layout: page to layout: single and remove references to icon-github.html (or copy to your _includes if using).     That’s it! If all goes well running bundle exec jekyll serve should spin-up your site. If you encounter any bumps please file an issue on GitHub and make sure to indicate you’re testing the pre-release Ruby gem version.   File an issue   Thanks!  ","categories": ["docs","Jekyll"],

I noticed that there is Guix package in Copr repository. Then I enabled that repository and installed Guix.   # dnf copr enable lantw44/guix # dnf install guix   First I started the guix-daemon service and enabled it:   # systemctl start guix-daemon.service # systemctl enable guix-daemon.service   Then I tried to install Guile like this as a normal user (baiju):   $ guix package -i guile   But I had to guix pull before that:   $ guix pull   I was trying to do these things as a normal user.  But there was some error about some permission issue for a directory.  So I changed it like this:   chown baiju.baiju /var/guix/profiles/per-user/baiju   Then I tried the package installation again using the package -i subcommand.   After installation Guix showed me that I need to update my PATH. So I just updated my .bashrc like this (guix shows this after installation!):   export PATH=\"/home/baiju/.guix-profile/bin${PATH:+:}$PATH\"     When starting guile it was showing a warning like this: warning: failed to install locale   Then I found that glibc-locales package need to be installed and an environment variable need to be updated.   guix package -i glibc-locales export GUIX_LOCPATH=$HOME/.guix-profile/lib/locale   I also added the above environment variable setting in my .bashrc.

So, I thought of requesting Go community members to do it for me.  This blog is about why you should review and how you can do it.  After reading this, if you are interested, please contact me via email: baiju.m.mail@gmail.com   Thanks for helping me with the technical reviewing of my book.  Your feedback and suggestions are very much valuable to me in writing this book.  I will show you how you can provide your feedback.  Before that, let’s see why you should review my book?      This book is going to help many people to learn Go programming.  As a fellow Go community member, you are contributing to this effort.   Your feedback is going to influence the content of the book.   As you study the book with a critical mind, you are enhancing your Go knowledge.  The learning is more intense than reading a book casually.   You will be required to refer other works to verify the content in the text.  This will help you to broaden your knowledge on the subject.   You are supporting a fellow Go community member.  This will motivate me to contribute more.   Bonus 1: You are getting the free PDF copy of the book.   Bonus 2: Your name will be mentioned in the book at the beginning in the acknowledgment just after the preface.   Now I want to provide some suggestions on how you can help me with the book review.  Ask these kinds of questions while you are going through the book.      How is the organization of the chapters in the book?   How is the organization of sections under each chapter?   Is the book consistent throughout all the pages?  (Consider consistency of organization, style of writing, terminology usage, etc.)   Is there any essential point missed when explaining a particular topic?   Is the logical flow of introducing the concepts easy to follow?   Is the narrative clear, reasonable, and compelling?   Are the examples and exercises short and easy to understand?   Did you notice any sentence or paragraph that is difficult to understand?   Did you see an opportunity to add a side-note which will be helpful to the reader?   Did you notice any awkward English language usage? (You can ignore minor language issues.)   How to make this book more interesting? Any thoughts?   When you send me feedback about a particular chapter, please specify the chapter title.  If the input is about a section, please include the section number and chapter title.  No need to mention the page number as it may change.   You don’t need to wait for completing the whole book to send me the review comments.  As soon as you finish one chapter or even one section, you can send the feedback.   Sometimes I may not be able to work on your feedback immediately.  But I will add it to my action items as soon as possible.  I will send you updated copies as I make progress.   Looking forward to your feedback and suggestions!  ","categories": ["golang","book"],

        "excerpt":"After I published my last blog post requesting technical reviews of my Go book, I received quite a few responses from the Go community. Thanks to all who came forward to review the book.   Let me give some context before getting into the details of the subject of this blog post. I started working on my book around mid of 2015. However, I couldn’t continue to work on it for a long time. I had decided to self-publish my book from the beginning. I made the book available through Gumroad at a small price in PDF format. Few have bought the book so far. I usually update the book whenever I make some progress.   As I continue to work on the book, the question I ponder these days is about the expectations of a reader for an introductory programming book. I would like to hear your thoughts on the same. You can write your thoughts on your blog, comment anywhere where I share this post, or you can write to me via email: baiju@muthukadan.net   Okay, let me rephrase the question:   As a reader who is beginning with programming and software development, what are the expectations you will have when buying an introductory programming book?     Now let me share some of my observations on the topic. These are some of the things I am trying to fulfill in my book. Some of the revelations are very recent, so you will not see it reflected in the current work.      Few are expecting a realistic project unfolded throughout the book. So far I have used frivolous standalone examples everywhere in the book. Probably I can go for a hybrid approach — present one problem in the exercises section which keeps developing from the 3rd or 4th chapter and continues till the end.   Use practical compact examples. As I mentioned in the previous point, many of the current examples are silly. Using realistic examples are a hard thing to do; I do not want to lose focus when explaining a concept with details of the problem at hand.   Whenever a new feature is getting introduced, compare it with a similar feature in another programming language. I have intentionally tried to avoid any comparison, though it has crept in few places. I am still skeptical about this idea.   Focus on “why” and not the syntax. I need to do more work on this issue. I should explain why certain features exist while explaining the syntax and semantics.   The book should be available in many formats including EPUB, MOBI, PDF, and paperback. One of the challenges I am facing is typesetting the book so that it will look good in all forms.   Now it’s your turn, think about the original question and write about it! I will look forward to your thoughts on the expectations for an introductory programming book.
