Last update about my Golang workshops was in June 2016.  In the last 6
months many things happened in my life.  I changed my job, after
working 9 years and 7 months at ZeOmega joined Red Hat.  Our second
son born in last August.  Became co-organizer of Bangalore Golang user
group and started organizing meetups.  Along with all these things,
conducted 3 more Golang workshops.

The 5th workshop was on July 9th at BangTheTable office organized by Bangalore Golang meetup group:
