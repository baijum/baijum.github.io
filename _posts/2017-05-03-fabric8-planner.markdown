Yesterday Red Hat
[announced](https://www.redhat.com/en/about/press-releases/red-hat-unveils-end-end-cloud-native-development-environment-red-hat-openshiftio)
[OpenShift.io](https://openshift.io).  For last 9 months, I was
working on one part of that system called Planner.  In simple words,
Planner is a project & issue tracking system.  In fact, most of my
work was in the upstream project called [Fabric8](https://fabric8.io).

I am still working on the Planner project.  Since this is an open
source project, I can write about it in my blog :) Though there will
be few things that I won't be able to share publicly.  For example, I
was not allowed to write about OpenShift.io before that was publicly
announced.

I am planning to write a series of blogs about Fabric8 mostly focusing
on Planner.  I am also giving a talk about [Fabric8 at DevConf.in
2017](https://rootconf.talkfunnel.com/devconf-2017/69-fabric8-an-end-to-end-development-platform)
which is a sub-conference under [Rootconf 2017](https://rootconf.in/2017/).

I am working on the
[backend](https://github.com/almighty/almighty-core) for Planner which
is written in [Go](https://golang.org/).  If you are interested to
contribute, I would be happy to talk to you.  You can reach me at
