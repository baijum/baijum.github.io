Recently I conducted couple of Go workshops.  The first workshop was
on February 27th at [NIT Calicut](http://www.nitc.ac.in) as part of
[FOSSMeet'16](http://fossmeet.in) program.  The second one was last
Saturday (April 16th) at NUMA Bangalore organized by
[Hasgeek](https://hasgeek.com) as part of
[Rootconf'16](https://rootconf.in/2016).

The workshop at NIT was a 4 hour workshop and particpants were
computer science students from various engineering colleges.

Few photos from the workshop:

well received.  Here are few photos and feedback from the workshop.
