Last Saturday I conducted one more Go workshop in Bangalore.  The
meetup was organized by [Practical Data
Science](https://www.meetup.com/Practical-Data-Science-Workshops-Bangalore/)
meetup group.  [Bargava](https://twitter.com/bargava) took initiative
to organize this workshop.  The meetup was hosted at Red Hat Bangalore
office.  Some of my colleagues,
[Zeeshan](https://twitter.com/@zee_10000), [Suraj
D](https://twitter.com/surajd_) and [Suraj
N](https://twitter.com/red_suraj) volunteered for the meetup.

I received lots of nice
[feedback](https://www.meetup.com/Practical-Data-Science-Workshops-Bangalore/events/238824064)
for the workshop.  Thank you all :)

If fact, I had conducted another Go workshop last March as part of
[FOSSMeet'17](http://fossmeet.in) at [NIT
Calicut](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Institute_of_Technology_Calicut).
It was not really a planned workshop.  It was decided just few days
before the conference as one of their speaker couldn't come.

One of the reason why I accepted the last moment invitation was the
nostalgia about going back to my college.  I came to this institute in
1998 and here I am taking a selfie :)

There was an [SMC hackathon](https://smc.org.in) lead by
[Balasankar](https://twitter.com/cbalasankar) and
[Jishnu](https://twitter.com/jishnu7):

I was able to spend some time with them also remembering it was 16
years before that I started [SMC](https://ml.wikipedia.org/wiki/സ്വതന്ത്രമലയാളംകമ്പ്യൂട്ടിങ്ങ്) while studying there.
