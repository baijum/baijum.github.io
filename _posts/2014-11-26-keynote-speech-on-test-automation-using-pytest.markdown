I delivered a [Keynote speech] on "Test Automation Using Pytest" at
"Non-Conventional Software Test Automation" conference.  The
conference was organized by a testing community.  I selected Pytest as
my topic and the talk was well received.  This was not really a Python
community, but when I asked how many knows Python, around 40% raised
their hands.  Thanks to the organizers for inviting me to speak!
