I have added a [new chapter on Page Objects] in my documenabouttation
for Selenium with Python.  Code in this chapter works and is quite
self-descriptive, but a little description wouldnâ€™t hurt.  If anyone
interested, please send pull request in [Github].  If you want an
example implementation, I have one as part of my project in Github
called [pitracker].

I would be very happy to review and accept your pull requests.  As you
can see in the [Github contributors graph], there are 18 external
contributors to this document.  Most of them made just one commit.

The other part of documentation where I am seeking more contribution
is chapter on [Frequently Asked Questions].
