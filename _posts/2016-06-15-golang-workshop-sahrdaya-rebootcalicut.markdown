My third Golang workshop was organized by Sahrdaya college of
engineering as part of the faculty development program.  Particants
were mostly computer science teachers from various engineering
colleges.  This was interesting, because my first Golang workshop
particants were computer science engineering students and second was
professional software developers.  The workshop was conducted on last
week of April.  I know, this is very late update ;)

As usual, Go was very new to all particants.  The prgram went very
well.  Few photos from the workshop:

The 4th Golang workshop was in Calicut.  Reboot Calicut is a new
conference started in Calicut by software professionals.  Since
Calicut is my home town, I was very happy to accept their invitation.
I can see that, the infrastructure in Calicut is improving every year.
I hope this conference will help many software developers.  The venue
location was was very good.  Few photos:
