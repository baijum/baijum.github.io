After I published my [last blog post requesting technical
reviews](https://medium.com/@baijum/request-for-technical-review-970c6685cf5e)
of my Go book, I received quite a few responses from
the Go community. Thanks to all who came forward to review the book.

Let me give some context before getting into the details of the subject
of this blog post. I started working on my book around mid of 2015.
However, I couldn't continue to work on it for a long time. I had
decided to self-publish my book from the beginning. I made the [book
available through Gumroad](https://gumroad.com/l/gobook)
at a small price in PDF format. Few have bought the
book so far. I usually update the book whenever I make some progress.

As I continue to work on the book, the question I ponder these days is
about the expectations of a reader for an introductory programming book.
I would like to hear your thoughts on the same. You can write your
thoughts on your blog, comment anywhere where I share this post, or you
can write to me via email: <baiju@muthukadan.net>

Okay, let me rephrase the question:

***As a reader who is beginning with programming and software
development, what are the expectations you will have when buying an
introductory programming book?***

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Now let me share some of my observations on the topic. These are some of
the things I am trying to fulfill in my book. Some of the revelations
are very recent, so you will not see it reflected in the current work.

1.  **Few are expecting a realistic project unfolded throughout the
    book.** So far I have used frivolous standalone examples everywhere
    in the book. Probably I can go for a hybrid approach --- present one
    problem in the exercises section which keeps developing from the 3rd
    or 4th chapter and continues till the end.
2.  **Use practical compact examples.** As I mentioned in the previous
    point, many of the current examples are silly. Using realistic
    examples are a hard thing to do; I do not want to lose focus when
    explaining a concept with details of the problem at hand.
3.  **Whenever a new feature is getting introduced, compare it with a
    similar feature in another programming language.** I have
    intentionally tried to avoid any comparison, though it has crept in
    few places. I am still skeptical about this idea.
4.  **Focus on "why" and not the syntax.** I need to do more work on
    this issue. I should explain why certain features exist while
    explaining the syntax and semantics.
5.  **The book should be available in many formats including EPUB,
    MOBI, PDF, and paperback.** One of the challenges I am facing is
    typesetting the book so that it will look good in all forms.

Now it's your turn, think about the original question and write about
it! I will look forward to your thoughts on the expectations for an
introductory programming book.
