Today was my 10th Golang workshop. It was organized by FISAT students
and staff as part of [ICEFOSS 2017 annual
event](http://archive.is/sB3yS).  There were around 40 participants
for my Go workshop.  All of them were computer science students from
various engineering colleges.

Now I am writing this from a hotel in Angamaly.  I reched here
yesterday very late night as my flight was delayed. My return flight
is tomorrow early morning.  My workshop was completed around 4.30 pm.
Later I came back to hotel and went for a small walk in the town.  As
I was tired, I couldn't go long.  Now I need to find something for
dinner and go to bed.
