This is the first time I am writing about my [recent
book](https://golang.muthukadan.net) on my blog.  It's an introductory
book on Go programming language.  Well, I started the project
sometimes back around mid of 2015.  I made some progress, then
self-published it through Gumroad.  I was hoping that I could make
progress eventually.  Giving free updated copies of the book through
Gumroad is easy.  That was the main reason I decided to use Gumroad.
But that plan didn't work out as expected.  Fortunately, not many had
bought them for their disappointment.  In fact, I never tried to
market the book.  I went back to writing on an off in the last few
years.  I do not want to list out all the excuses for not finishing
the book.

After my recent updates, now the book should be in a usable state.
However, some of the chapters still need more work.  I don't want to
make big promises.  I am trying my best to refine the later chapters
of the book which requires more attention.

If you would like to buy the ebook, visit the book site here:

is also a form to receive free chapters of the book.
