I just moved my main website to [GitHub pages][gh-pages].  GitHub
pages is interesting, it uses the static page and blog generator
called [Jekyll][jekyll].  It supports Markdown and Textile formats by
default.  Now all my [site source][source] is hosted in the GitHub.

My website never had any major content except the [ZCA book][zca].  So
it was not difficult to migrate.  I will try to write some blog posts
here.  Let me see how it goes :-)
