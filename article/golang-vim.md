title: Editing Go in Vim

I am using [vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) plugin manager.

This is my Vim configuration (``$HOME/.vimrc``):

## Short-cuts

* To jump to the definition: `gd`
* To autocomplete: `Ctrl+x+o`
* To see doc: `\gd`
* To see type info: `\i`
* To see the documentation: `:help vim-go`
* To change leader key: `:help <Leader>`
* To get help about a particular operation: `:help :GoDoc`
